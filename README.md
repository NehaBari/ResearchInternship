The goal of this project was to account fot the generalization propoerty of a shallow neural network as the size of the dataset. The dataset size was tuned using the alpha parameter and was testing using the ReLU and the Sigmoidal activation function.

Dataset: The dataset used is a randomised dataset generated using randn function
